# Motif Discovery Algorithms

This repository contains a Python implementation of various algorithms for motif discovery in biological sequences. The algorithms include:

- Enumeration
- Deterministic (Greedy Algorithm)
- Probabilistic (Genetic Algorithm)

## Features

- Count occurrences of motifs in a sequence
- Identify the most common motifs
- Implement greedy search for motif discovery
- Apply genetic algorithms for probabilistic motif discovery

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Random library (included in Python standard library)

## Additional Tools
In addition to the implemented algorithms, this project also utilizes external tools such as MEME and GLAM for motif discovery. These tools provide advanced algorithms for identifying and analyzing motifs in biological sequences, enhancing the capabilities of our analysis.
